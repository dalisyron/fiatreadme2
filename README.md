% Fiat âˆ’ Deductive Synthesis of Abstract Data Types in a Proof Assistant<br />
  POPL 2015 Artifact evaluation

**Fiat refines declarative specifications into functional programs
  that can be run with good performance, and it all happens inside Coq
  without modifications. Our artifact includes three examples
  utilizing a library for specifying ADTs with SQL-like operations and
  automatically deriving implementations using tactics. It also
  includes the manual derivation of an implementation of one such ADT
  that automatically caches queries.**

## Getting started

Thanks for evaluating this artifact! Here is how to get started:

1. Download the [paper](fiat.pdf).

2. Download the artifact: choose one of these three options

    * [OVA virtual machine](fiat-gui.ova) (~ 1.8GB; Linux Mint)
    * [OVA virtual machine, no GUI](fiat-nogui.ova) (~ 1GB; Ubuntu server)
    * [Source code tarball](fiat.tar.gz) (~ 130kB; see the dependencies section below)

    In the virtual machines, use username `fiat` and password
    `fiat`. The source code is in `/home/fiat/popl2015/`

3. Compile the source code (not necessary in the VM):

    `$ make sources`

4. Start exploring the examples!

    The best way to get a feeling of how the library works is to step
    through the semi-automated refinement of the bookstore example
    from the paper found in `examples/BookstoreSemiAutomatic.v`.

    The `examples` folder contains three further fully-automated
    example refinements of ADTs with SQL-like operations:

    + `Bookstore.v` uses the same specification as
      `BookstoreSemiAutomatic.v`, but uses the `plan` tactic found in
      `src/QueryStructure/Refinements/AutoDB.v` to automatically
      derive an implementation.

    + `Stocks.v` and `Weather.v` contain the two additional examples
      from Section 5.2 of the paper, featuring more complex indexing
      schemes, and more diverse aggregation operators.

    `CacheADT/LRUCache.v` demonstrates the manual derivation of the
    least recently used cache discussed in Section 3.1 of the paper.

    `BookstoreCache.v` utilizes the LRUCache derived in
    `CacheADT/LRUCache.v` to build the version of the bookstore
    example from Section 4.7 which caches queries using finite
    differencing.

## Technical details

### Dependencies

* To build the library:          `Coq 8.4pl2`
* To step through the examples:  `GNU Emacs 23.4.1, Proof General 4.3`
* To extract and run OCaml code: `OCaml 3.12.1`

### Compiling

* To build the library: `make sources`
* To extract the bookstore example to OCaml: `make repl` (rather slow)
* To build all the examples: `make examples` (slow; *not* required to
  step through the examples in emacs!). Note that compiling all examples
  requires a significant amount of memory (> 2GB).

## Going further

### Extracting and running OCaml code

Running `make repl` extracts the bookstore example code and produces a
`repl` binary in the `examples/` directory, which supports the following
commands:

    reset
    add_book    [author title isbn]
    place_order [isbn]
    get_titles  [author]
    num_orders  [author]
    benchmark   [nb_authors nb_books nb_orders nb_titles_queries nb_orders_queries]

To replicate the results highlighted in the paper, run `examples/repl`,
and type

    benchmark 1000 10000 100000 100000 100000
